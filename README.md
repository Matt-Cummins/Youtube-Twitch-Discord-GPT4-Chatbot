# Twitch-Discord-GPT4-Bot
This is unfinished!

Twitch/Discord chatbot, OpenAI GPT4 integration, designed for flight simulation streamers.

The Python script is designed to perform a variety of tasks, including natural language processing, asynchronous web searches, fetching METAR data, and operating a Twitch bot. Here's a basic breakdown of its capabilities:

Natural Language Processing (NLP);

The script utilizes the OpenAI API to generate responses based on conversation history and initial prompts. This allows it to understand and process human language, making it suitable for applications that require interaction with users in natural language.

Audio Processing and Transcription;

With imports like pyaudio, numpy, and whisper, the script hints at capabilities for audio processing and transcription, to transcribe spoken words into text for processing or responding to audio inputs. However, the detailed implementation/usage of these functionalities isn't yet fully set up.

Asynchronous Web Searches;

It can perform web searches using the Google Custom Search API asynchronously. This means it can handle multiple search requests simultaneously without waiting for each one to finish before starting the next, leading to more efficient search operations.

METAR Data Fetching;

METAR data, which is essential for weather reporting and forecasting, can be retrieved by the script. This functionality is particularly useful for applications that need real-time or historical weather data.

Twitch Bot Operation;

The script can connect to a specified Twitch channel and operate as a bot. It can interact with users by responding to specific commands in the chat prefixed with !. The bot can handle queries such as "search for," "find," "look up," "what is," "who is," and "tell me about," making it a versatile tool for engaging with a Twitch audience.

Additional Features;

The script is designed to send messages in chunks to avoid Twitch rate limits, ensuring smooth operation during interactions. It requires the configuration of several environment variables for Twitch, OpenAI, and Google Custom Search API to function correctly. The script is structured to be accessible for users with no prior experience in programming or working with Python scripts, as detailed in the provided instruction manual.
